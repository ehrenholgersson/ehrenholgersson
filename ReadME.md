# :wave:  Hey :wave:

I'm Ehren,

Most of my repositories are projects I created for a Certificate IV in Game Development and programming at TAFE.

## Some of My Projects

### [Shape Skirmishes](https://github.com/ehrenholgersson/ShapeGame)
2D platformer inspired by Geometry Dash / The Impossible Game. Name inspired by Geometry Wars because I always mix that up with Geometry Dash! 

Originally started as something totally different in TAFE, but it got sidetracked and turned into its own thing. I plan to add more level pieces, sounds and a difficulty curve, then polish it up a bit and maybe release on itch.io to gain experience in the process of actually releasing something.

### [Smashformer](https://github.com/ehrenholgersson/Group-Project---Game-Design)
2D fighting game somewhat inspired by Smash Brothers done as a group project in TAFE. All code by myself.

### [Picnic in the Park (Hangman)](https://github.com/ehrenholgersson/HangMan2D_Game_Systems_Intro_To_Programming)
Fairly simple Hangman game made for TAFE to demonstrate saving settings and game progress as well as UI. 2D Game created with a 3D background made from Unity's terrain system (and a number of free assets from the asset store).

### Unnamed Space Game 
2D game where you can build and fly custom space ships between different planets and (hopefully one day) solar systems. 

This is a long term project that I have been working on for some time. I'm trying to focus my efforts on smaller things that can be built quickly to develop my portfolio right now, but this project is my baby and I struggle to put it down for any length of time.

Currently you can build your own ships and fly between 3 planets, there are AI traders that fly between the planets and pirates that will attack them.

Multiplayer is partially implemented.
