            Untitled Space Game
        </h1>
        <p>
            A 2D Space combat and trading game Iâ€™ve been working on for some time. The player is able to travel and fight(shoot) and foot and while flying spacecraft they design and build themselves. <br><br>

            The intent is for a sandbox experience where the player can travel between multiple star systems exploring trading and taking on combat missions. Initially however I intend to create a prototype containing just a few planets and a much simpler game loop where the player receives a monetary reward for defeating pirates and can use this to upgrade their ship in order to defeat a pirate boss.<br><br><br>
        
            Some of Features I have developed to some extent at this stage include:<br><br></p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">

                    The ability to fly between different planets across a large distance.<br><br>
