        <p>
            I am a Unity/C# developer, you can see some of my past and present work on the projects section of this site. I have also experimented with Unreal and Godot to the point where I at least have some familiarity working in those environments. You can see some of my past and present work in the projects section of this site.<br><br>

            Previously I've worked in IT/Desktop support, assisting businesses and home users on a huge range of hardware and software products from printers to servers to VoIP solutions.<br><br>

            I've lived and worked in the north east of Sydney, Australia for pretty much my whole life. On the weekends I play in the great outdoors, most often climbing or canyoning in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, although I do also scuba dive from time to time. Through these activities I have become actively involved with the UTS Outdoor Activity Club as a trip leader, and will more occasionally assist NSW Scouts on their adventures as an Adult Helper.<br><br>
